# Texy-Python
Our roots are based in text... We have alot of graphic engines, we even have one in python named Pygame. Text-based games are lacking, so why not make one yourself. This is Texy.py, a text-based game engine made in python. This is not a beta, but if anyone want's to contribute to the project, go ahead. This is a one-person project so everything is helpfull.
