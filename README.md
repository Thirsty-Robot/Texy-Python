# Texy-Python
Our roots are based in text... We have alot of graphic engines, we even have one in python named Pygame. Text-based games are lacking, so why not make one yourself. This is Texy.py, a text-based game engine made in python. This is not a beta, but if anyone want's to contribute to the project, go ahead. This is a one-person project so everything is helpfull.

## Vision
We want to help amateur programmers interested in creating games to learn how [Object Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) works.

## About Texy.py
Texy.py is a python library for text-based game development. You can change your terminal text colot, dice rolls, check for input and more!

## Installation
Download the distribution from [here](https://test-files.pythonhosted.org/packages/68/34/26018f75aedc3ac6c802c5fbbaf41b8bc0b89f6d6be6cd7a32c279192265/texy-py-1.0.0.tar.gz).

Open a terminal and move to the download path, of the file.
